<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>I'm Crisanta, I'm an aspiring web developer and I've worked with Accenture for 4 years and 8 months 
as part of Software and Platform Teams project under Business Operation Integrity. </p>
  
I spend most of my time studying Web Development Course online in Udemy Inc. 
Aside from being frustated code geeks, I am also active in multi-sports such as cycling, running and swimming.</p>

If you believe we have the same energy and passion, feel free to contact me.
